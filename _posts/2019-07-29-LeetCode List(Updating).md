LeetCode Question List

| Question                                  | Type                  | Description                                                  | Solution                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.Two Sum                                 | HashMap               | Return indeices of two numbers such that sum of them == target | Keep a HashMap and do a linear search, see if target - cur exists in Hashmap |
| 2. Add Two Numbers                        | LinkedList            | Add Two LinkedLists                                          | Just traverse the linked list and add. Pay attention to different length of the numbers and carry on. |
| 3. Longest Substr wo repting chars        | Index moving          | As the title                                                 | When we see a repeating character, we update the starting index. We use hashMap to keep the info of where each char first appear and use that to calculate the result. |
| 4. Median of Two **Sorted** Arrs          | Merge & sort          | As the title                                                 | Just like a merge operation in merge sort. Pay attention to odd and even length of the array. |
| 5. Longest Palindromic Substr             | Index moving          | As the title                                                 | The question asks to return the palindrome. We need to find and keep the start and the length of the palindrome so we can rebuild it. Pay attention to multiple duplicate chars may appear in the center of the palindrome. Deal with them first and then update the index. |
| 6. ZigZag Conversion                      | Implementation        | Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4 Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI" Explanation:  P     I    N A   L S  I G Y A   H R P     I (like a reverse N) | With extra storage:  Just loop through the string,  Keep track of the direction you're going and keep a storage of chars in a row. In the end merge all rows in the result.                   Without extra storage: Add every character in a row at the same time to the result. You can calculate the gap of index given the shape and the number of rows. |
| 8.String to Integer (atoi)                | Implementation        | Basically ATOI, but you have a lot of constraints.           | Consider how to meet all the constraints in the simplest way when implementing the answer. Always check the requirement in the question. Ask yourself what else constrains or possibilities are implied by the question. |
| 11. Container With Most water             | Two pointer(Greedy)   | Find the largest area determined by two values in the array  | Moving the two index from the two ends, since the gap is always getting smaller, so we want the smaller value to be greater. We move the (left) pointer only when the right end is greater than the left end or otherwise (right). |
| 15. 3Sum                                  | Moving index          | a+b+c == 0                                                   | Sort the array, we loop the array, keep arr[i] as  the smallest number in the sequences and use two pointers l and r. When the sum is less or equal to target, we move l as long as the number at the point is the same as the one after. Same thing for the right side. We are taking advantage of the sorted sequence just like binary search. Pay attention to arr[i] larger than the target and duplicate arr[i]. |
| 16. 3Sum Closest                          | Moving indexUs        | Almost the same as 3 Sum                                     | We are looking for the closest sum right now. Change the way we're updating the answer, and every procedure is the same as that in 3 Sum. |
| 17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number | DFS                   | Phone key combination                                        | Keep a table of number to letters and then do DFS to find all combinations. |
| 18. 4 Sum                                 | Moving index          | as title                                                     | Very similar to 3 Sum. Add one more layer of iteration. Difference is that we now have more exceptional cases to consider when doing the loops. |
| 19. Remove Nth Node from end of list      | Linked list           | as title                                                     | Using two index, one pointing N elements ahead of the other, when the first one reach the end of the linkedlist, the other one is now pointing to the element to be removed.  Notice that you should init the two pointers to point to the node before the first node. |
| 20. Valid Parentheses                     | Stack                 | as title                                                     | When stack gets empty or stack top mismatches.               |
| 22. Generate Parentheses                  | DFS                   | as title                                                     | Keep a counter of left parentheses used and right parenthese to be used |
| 23. Merge K Sorted Lists                  | Linked List           | as title                                                     | Just like merge sort. This time, merging sorted lists. (Like a merge sort done in half actually) Pay attention to check null and pointed content when doing linked list problems. |
| 24. Swap Nodes in Pairs                   | Linked List           | Swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.           | Linked list implementation problem. To keep the index, find our the length first. Then do swap and index shifting every time. |
| 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group              | Linked List           | Reverse the numbers in group of K                            | You have to find the length first to do the iteration. Then do reverse in k iterations. |
| 26. Remove duplicate in sorted array      | Implementation        | Remove duplicate,  do the modification the same array and return the length afterwards. | Keep a index i of the modified array, when a  non-duplicate found, increase i and copy the value to index i. |
| 27. Remove element                        | Almost the same as 26 |                                                              |                                                              |
| 28. Implement strStr()                    | Implementation        | Find first Occurence of a string                             | ...                                                          |
| 31. Next Permutation(VIP)                 | Implementation        |                                                              | See Post (& Last Permutation)                                |
| 32. Longest Valid Parentheses(VIP)        | Stack                 |                                                              | See Post                                                     |
| 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array        | Binary Search         |                                                              | Modified binary search. First Search for the turning point.  The do modified binary search based on adjusted index. |
