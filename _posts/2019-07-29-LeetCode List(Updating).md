| 60. Permutation Sequence(VIP)                               | (Obviously you can't use DFS here)         | The k th permutation                                         | Do a post on this question.                                  |
| 61. Rotate List                                             | Linked List                                | Rotate the linkedlist by k places                            | Inplace solution: Make the original linked list into a loop and then cut at kth place. Or you can create a list and move the last k elements to the new list and then merge. |
| 62. Unique Paths                                            | DP (Summing)                               | All unique paths moving accross a checker-board              | The base case is that the robot can move to every point in the graph with at least one unique path. The original dp expression would be f\[i][j] = f\[i][j - 1] + f\[i - 1][j]. However, we can determine that f\[i - 1][j] is the sum of f\[i - 1][0] to f\[i - 1][j - 1]. So we can remove the dimension of i by just suming f[j] = f[j - 1] for N times. Since each summing has included the sum from the last row. |
| 63. Unique Paths 2                                          | DP(Summing)                                | Obstacles placed                                             | When an obstacle appears, f[j] = 0, that's the only difference. |
| 64. Minimum Path Sum                                        | DP                                         | top left to bottom right                                     | f\[i][j] = min(f\[i - 1][j], f\[i][j - 1] ) + w\[i][j] Make sure that you init all grids except for those around the starting block to the MAX value. |
| 65. Valid Number                                            | Implementation                             | ...                                                          | Too complicated                                              |
| 66. Text Justification                                      | Implementation                             | ...                                                          | Just pay a lot of attention to details and have a clear understanding of what you're trying to write right now. |
| 71. Simplify Path                                           | Implementation with stack                  | Simplify an absolute path                                    | Path attention to the rules. Use stack to deal with \'..'    |
| 72. Edit Distance                                           | dp                                         | classical question                                           | f\[i][j] = f\[i - 1][j - 1] when chars equal, f\[i][j] = min(f\[i][j - 1], f\[i - 1][j - 1], f\[i - 1][j]) + 1. Make sure to init f\[i][0] and f\[0][i] to corresponding is since the base case is to delete every letter when the length is 0. |
| 73. Set Matrix Zeros                                        | Implementation                             | Given aÂ *m*Â xÂ *n*Â matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. | Add some bool marks to check whether the row should be set zero. Store the information about which row is the last zero row. Do not update the last zero row to all zero at first, since we are using the last zero row to store the info about which column to clear. Then use info in the last zero row to update the column case. In this way, we can do the operation **in place**. |
| 74. Search a 2d matrix                                      | Binary Search                              | Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in anÂ *m*Â xÂ *n*matrix. | First you search which row the target belongs to, and then you. Then Search for the target in the row. |
| 75. Sort colors                                             | Implementation                             |                                                              | Write a merge sort or just can use bucket sort.              |
| 76. Minimum Window Substring                                | Sliding window like problem                | Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n). | First record the count of each character in the target array. Then we keep two pointers and do updates on the count. The key is to keep a temp to find out how many letters we have not found in the source array. If we still have not found the required array, move end pointer forward (the longer, the more possible that it contains all the letters), then we try to minimize the length by moving start forward. |
| 77. Combinations                                            | DFS                                        | return all possible combinations of k numbers out of 1...n   | Just modified DFS from finding all combinations. Besides recoding the last position, you should also keep track of what numbers are used since we are not asked to use up all the numbers. |
| 78. Subsets                                                 | DFS                                        | Given a set ofÂ **distinct**Â integers,Â *nums*, return all possible subsets (the power set). | Sort the array and just push back every combination you visit. |
| 79. Word Search                                             | DFS                                        | Find a work in a 2d board                                    | Just do normal dfs, but one smart update method is to set the grid to some value that may not exist in the word so we don't need to keep an extra array of visited nodes. Remember to do border check. |
| 80. Remove duplicates from sorted array 2                   | implementation                             | remove duplicates in place, appear at most twice             | just keep a counter and do remove.                           |

Largest Rectangle in Histogram                          | Greedy                                     | Largest rectangle formed                                     | We are trying to find the values as large as possible, so we use a stack that keeps an increasing array of values looped in the array. Then we do the pop option when the stack is not empty and the current value is samller than the top of the stack. Then calculate the area. If stack is empty use the stack top height times i, else use the last highest value to time the gap. |
